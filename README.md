# Automated.Malware.Generation

Additional code and data for the automated malware generation paper

## Organization

* *support*: Data related to the function support experiments.
* *generated_files*: All files I generated. I intentionally disarmed the samples before sharing, so some of them do not properly run in sandboxes.
* *scanned_files*: Virustotal reports for all files I scanned. Unfortunately, some labels have changed since my first submission.
* *parsed_funcs.zip*: Functions used by the malware samples.
