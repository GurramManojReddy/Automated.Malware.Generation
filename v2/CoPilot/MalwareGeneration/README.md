# MalwareGeneration

## Introduction

In this experiment, we will automate Copilot to generate suggestions for the building block prompts. These suggestions will then be compiled to generate the binaries.

### Note

This repository includes both client and server-side code for the experiment. Make sure to modify the copilot_automation.au3 file to customize it according to your VSCode setup. This customization ensures smooth integration and execution within your development environment.

## Repository

### Organization

The repository is organized as follows:

#### Server

* **server.py**:
  This file contains the code to activate the server in a VM or individual machine where we want to run the experiemnt.
  
* **code_generation.py**:
  This contains the code for generating the suggestions for the prompts using copilot.
  
* **Copilot_Automation.exe**:
  This file contains the automation code for the copilot.
  
* **code_compiling.py**:
  This file contains the code for putting the blocks together and generating all possible binaries.
  
* **BuildingBlocks.txt**:
  This file has the prompts for all the buildingblocks.
  
* **Main.c**:
  This file contains the main function that is needed to compile the code.
  
#### Client

* **project.sh**:
  This setup enables us to execute a command that triggers the client.py file. The client.py file, in turn, communicates with the server, facilitating the exchange of information and actions between the client and the server components.
  
* **client.py**:
  This file contains the code necessary to send requests to the server by providing the desired number of variations as input. The code facilitates receiving responses from the server and downloads the response zip file. This zip file contains metadata for the binaries, malware binaries, and building blocks.

## Building and Running

To start the server, navigate to the directory where the server is located using the command line interface (CLI) and then run the following command in the terminal:
```python
python server.py
```
After activating the server, follow these steps on the machine with the client code:
1. Navigate to the directory containing the client code using the command line interface (CLI).
2. Run the following command in the terminal::
```bash
project.sh ./results 5
```
In this command:

  * ./results indicates the directory where the results will be downloaded.
  * 5 specifies that the server should generate 5 variations for each building block.

Adjust the command parameters as needed based on your specific setup and requirements. This command will initiate the client code to communicate with the server and request the generation of variations as specified.
